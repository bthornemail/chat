Currently, there is no recognized entity or concept called "courseNFT" in the realms of education, technology or cryptocurrency. The term seems to be a combination of two words - "course" and "NFT".

1. "Course" usually refers to a program of study on a particular subject, typically in higher or secondary education. 

2. NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token, which is a kind of cryptographic token on a blockchain that represents a unique item or piece of content.

If "courseNFT" was a concept, it could theoretically relate to an idea of tokenizing educational courses or content through NFTs. But as of now, there's no widely recognized or implemented concept with this name.

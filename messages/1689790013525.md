Vertcoin (VTC) is a decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency that is based on the Bitcoin protocol. 

It aims to keep its mining process decentralized, providing an equitable distribution of the currency, and ensuring that it remains accessible to everyday computer users by using algorithms, Proof-of-Work (PoW), that resist the centralization of mining power.

In the context of this project, VertCoin is an ERC20 compatible token created in the Ethereum blockchain to enable certain functionalities within the smart contracts. This is not the same as the Vertcoin (VTC) which is an entirely independent cryptocurrency.

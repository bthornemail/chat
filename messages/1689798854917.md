CourseNFT is a smart contract written in Solidity for Ethereum based networks. It illustrates the potential use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) for educational courses. This contract is using the ERC721 standard for NFTs.

Here's how this contract works:

1. It defines a structure for Courses, Tasks, Tests, and Exams with relevant details such as their creators, IDs, verification status, IPFS hashes for data storage and details regarding scores and answers.

2. A new course is created through the `createCourse` function wherein the course name, description, and a resource link are provided. This function emits a 'CourseCreated' event with the course's details.

3. Similarly, a function `createTest` and `verifyTest` are provided for managing the creation and verification of tests in a particular course. Each time a test is created or verified, an event is emitted recording this action.

4. Likewise, tasks are managed using `createTask` and `verifyTask` functions. 

5. Exams can be created using `createExam` which allows linking multiple tests and tasks to an exam.

6. The contract also includes various getter functions that allow one to fetch full details of the course, tasks, tests, and exams present in that contract.

This might be used in a decentralized education platform where courses are offered as NFTs. It also maintains transparency by keeping every detail such as course creation, test, tasks, and their verification on the blockchain.

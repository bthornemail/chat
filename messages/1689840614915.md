MoversOnlineNow appears to be a decentralized network service and protocol for independent moving contractors. It's designed to operate on the Ethereum network using off-chain signed typed-data Ethereum transactions and off-chain signed messages to track jobs. 

Key features proposed include:
1. Tracking jobs offered and accepted.
2. Escrowing funds.
3. Tracking ratings and reviews of account holders.

Also, the proposal mentions the use of InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to interface with smart contracts and limit liability. There seem to be plans for three versions of the client-side app, each with different functionalities and intended users.

It's important to note that the details provided are just a proposed structure, and the actual implementation may vary significantly.

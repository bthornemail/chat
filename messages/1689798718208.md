`CourseNFT` is a Solidity contract for a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) that represents a course. NFTs are tokens that we can use to represent ownership of unique items. They let us tokenize things like courses, tasks, exams, tests in this context. 

Here's how `CourseNFT` contract works:

- It defines structures for `Course`, `Test`, `Task`, `Exam` which extend ERC721 from OpenZeppelin contracts. 
- It has events for the creation, verification of tests, tasks, and exams.
- Each `Course` includes a name, description, resourceLink, and a list of exam IDs associated with it.
- Each `Test` has a creator, a flag to indicate verification, an IpfsHash and correctAnswers which are related to questions in the test.
- Each `Task` has a creator, a flag to indicate verification, an IpfsHash, and a score.
- Each `Exam` includes a creator, a flag to indicate verification status, and list of ids for related tests and tasks.
- This contract has functions for creation of a course, a test, a task, an exam, and their verification.
- Function `getCourseDetails`, `getTestDetails`, `getTaskDetails`, `getExamDetails` are for getting the details about courses, tests, tasks, and exams respectively.
- Function `getTestQuestionCount` is a helper function to get the question count for a test.
  
This contract offers flexibility and lets decentralized apps manage and verify the progress in courses.

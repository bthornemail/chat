Here's a general guide on how you might accomplish these tasks:

First, you'll need to import the ethers.js library in your `server.ts` file. Ethers.js is a general-purpose library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.

```javascript
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
```

Next, you'll want to set up your connection to Ethereum, as well as compile and deploy the AssetNFT contract.

```javascript
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider("http://localhost:8545"); // Note: replace with your Ethereum node URL
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet("0xYourPrivateKey");
const signer = wallet.connect(provider);

let assetNFTFactory = new ethers.ContractFactory(AssetNFT.abi, AssetNFT.bytecode, signer);
let assetNFT = await assetNFTFactory.deploy();
await assetNFT.deployed();
```

Now you can create new endpoints for your server to interact with your AssetNFT contract. First, create an endpoint to mint new AssetNFTs:

```javascript
app.post('/mint', async (req, res) => {
   let tx = await assetNFT.mint(req.body.recipient, req.body.id);
   res.send(tx);
});
```

Next, create an endpoint to register assets:

```javascript
app.post('/registerAsset', async (req, res) => {
    let tx = await assetNFT.registerAsset(req.body.metadata),
    await tx.wait();
    res.send(tx);
});
```

Note: uploading an image could require converting the image data to base64 and storing it as metadata. You would handle file uploads in Express using the multer middleware.

Next, create endpoints to view assets and trade assets:

```javascript
app.get('/asset/:id', async (req, res) => {
    let asset = await assetNFT.assets(req.params.id);
    res.send(asset);
});

app.post('/transferAsset', async (req, res) => {
    let tx = await assetNFT.transferAsset(req.body.assetId, req.body.newOwner);
    await tx.wait();
    res.send(tx);
});
```

Please note that the exact implementation can be different based on the details in the AssetNFT contract. Always test the implementations in a safe environment before working on the mainnet or handling valuable assets.

I apologize for any confusion, it seems there was a mistake in my response. Going back to your request, you posted MultiSigWallet.sol, ServiceNFT.sol, VertCoin.sol, AssetNFT.sol, and CourseNFT.sol contracts. These are Ethereum Smart Contracts. Each contract has a specific functionality:

1. **MultiSigWallet.sol**: This contract is for creating a multi-signature wallet. Multi-signature wallets are security measures that require multiple private key holders to sign transactions coming out of the wallet.

2. **ServiceNFT.sol**: This represents services as Non-Fungible Tokens, or NFTs, on the Ethereum Blockchain. NFTs represent ownership of unique items or services.

3. **VertCoin.sol**: This is an ERC20 Token contract. ERC20 is a standard interface for tokens, meaning ERC20 tokens are simply a subset of Ethereum tokens. This particular contract also includes staking functionality.

4. **AssetNFT.sol**: This contract represents assets as NFTs on the Ethereum Blockchain. These assets can be rented with specific terms defined like rental price, duration, etc.

5. **CourseNFT.sol**: This contract represents a course as an NFT. The course includes tests, tasks, and exams that are used to structure the education process.

Each contract has its own functionality and can interact with specific ERC standards on the Ethereum Blockchain. They are written in Solidity programming language, the most popular language for writing Ethereum Smart Contracts.

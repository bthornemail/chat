The Solidity contract named "Governance" you provided seems to create a simple voting mechanism. Here are the details of its structure:

1. **State Variables:** The contract has 3 main state variables.
   - `owner` stores the owner's address when the contract is first deployed.
   - `proposals` is an array to store all the proposals. Each proposal has a `description` and a `voteCount`.
   - `voters` is a mapping to keep track of all the addresses that are allowed to vote.

2. **Constructor:** The constructor sets the contract's `owner` to the address that deploys the contract.

3. **addVoter function:** This function can only be called by the contract owner. It takes an address as input and adds that address to the `voters` mapping, allowing the address to vote on proposals.

4. **createProposal function:** This function allows a verified voter to create a new proposal. It takes a string description as an input and adds the proposal to the `proposals` array with the vote count set to zero.

5. **vote function:** This function allows verified voters to vote on a proposal. It takes the index of a proposal as an input and increments the vote count for the corresponding proposal. 

This is a very basic contract for governance voting. A full-featured governance contract would typically add more complexity, such as limiting one vote per address, time locking the voting period, and clear rules for majority rules and proposal execution.

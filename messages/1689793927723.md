A governance contract is a smart contract that facilitates decision-making processes within a decentralized organization or protocol. The shape of a governance contract varies depending on the specific governance model, but typically includes features such as voting mechanisms, proposal systems, and access controls.

Here's a simplified example of a governance contract in Solidity:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Governance {
    struct Proposal {
        string description;
        uint voteCount;
    }

    address public owner;
    Proposal[] public proposals;

    mapping(address => bool) public voters;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function addVoter(address _voter) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the contract owner can add voters");
        voters[_voter] = true;
    }

    function createProposal(string memory _description) public {
        require(voters[msg.sender], "Only voters can create proposals");
        proposals.push(Proposal(_description, 0));
    }

    function vote(uint _proposalIndex) public {
        require(voters[msg.sender], "Only voters can vote");
        proposals[_proposalIndex].voteCount++;
    }
}
```

Please note that this is just a very basic version, and real-world governance contracts can be considerably more complex with multiple safety checks, different voting mechanisms, and much more. Always make sure to have smart contracts thoroughly audited from a security perspective before using them in a real-world application.

CourseNFT seems to refer to a potential concept of combining online education with Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). While there isn't an established standard meaning for this term, the idea would be to create an NFT for each unique course or educational content. 

This would allow for the course to be bought, sold and traded similarly to other NFTs. It could also include special features such as certificates of completion or progress tracking. However, please note this is speculative and there is no wide information or implementation available. This combination of NFTs and online education could be a future trend to observe.

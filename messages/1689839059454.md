CourseNFT is a smart contract that represents digital courses as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. It uses the Ethereum Request for Comments (ERC) 721 standard, which is used for creating NFTs. 

Here's a breakdown of what the smart contract does:

- Defines structures such as Test, Task, Exam, and Course to represent elements of a digital course.
- Allows the creation of a new course with specific attributes like course name, description, and resource link. This new course is minted as an NFT.
- Allows the creation and verification of a test associated with a course.
- Permits the creation and verification of a task, and assigns it a score.
- Allows the creation and verification of an exam that might include multiple tests and tasks.
- Emits events when a course is created, a test is created or verified, a task is created or verified, or an exam is created or verified.
- Provides getter functions to fetch details of courses, tests, tasks, and exams by their respective IDs. 

This approach gives each course a unique ID, essentially creating a digital asset that can be bought, sold, or traded.

VertCoin and MoversOnlineNow are both blockchain solutions, but they serve different purposes and have different functionalities:

1. MoversOnlineNow: This is a decentralized application (dApp) or platform designed for the moving industry. It enables peer-to-peer interactions between independent movers and clients. It employs smart contracts on the Ethereum platform to offer services such as tracking jobs, escrowing funds, and account reviews or ratings.

2. VertCoin: This is an ERC20-compliant cryptocurrency token (VertCoin). It appears to be a standalone digital currency that can be used for different purposes like staking. There is a function that allows stakeholders to show their support for decisions by placing their tokens in a staking contract.

In summary, while VertCoin is a cryptocurrency token, MoversOnlineNow is an application/platform that could potentially utilize a token such as VertCoin or others for its transactions or services. They differ mainly in their use-cases; one is used as a currency, and the other is used as a service platform.

MoversOnlineNow and VertCoin are two different concepts and serve different purposes.

MoversOnlineNow appears to be a platform proposed to serve as a decentralized open network for independent moving contractors. The design suggests implementation on the Ethereum network, allowing tracking of jobs, escrowing funds for transactions, and managing reviews and ratings of account holders. It looks like it'll integrate off-chain signed messages and typed-data Ethereum transactions for various operations. It also suggests using the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to interface with smart contracts.

On the other hand, VertCoin seems to be a proposed ERC20 compliant cryptocurrency. The token could be used for various operations, including staking operations, with the staking details traceable to a MultiSigWallet. This token could be utilized within the MoversOnlineNow platform or any other platform that accepts ERC20 tokens for transactions. 

In summary, MoversOnlineNow is a platform for moving services, while VertCoin is a type of cryptocurrency that could be used on a platform like MoversOnlineNow or others for transactions.

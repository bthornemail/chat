Sorry for any confusion. You asked for a listing of various solidity smart contracts. Here are brief summaries of each one:

1. AssetNFT.sol: A smart contract using the ERC721 standard for creating Non-Fungible Tokens or NFTs that represents unique assets. It allows the registration, renting, return, and transfer of assets.

2. CourseNFT.sol: This is another ERC721 contract but for creating NFTs of courses. It defines structs to represent various educational elements (Tests, Tasks, Exams, and Courses) and functions to create, verify, and fetch these elements.

3. MultiSigWallet.sol: A multisignature wallet which requires multiple confirmations before executing transactions.

4. ServiceNFT.sol: An ERC721 contract for creating NFTs of services. It includes events and functions for registering, booking, canceling, transferring services, and getting service details.

5. VertCoin.sol: An ERC20 token contract named "VertCoin". It also includes a staking mechanism where holders can stake (lock up) their tokens.

Each of these contracts is written in Solidity, the primary language used for developing applications on the Ethereum blockchain. They leverage OpenZeppelin's library of secure and standardized contracts.

As an AI, I suggest that making upgrades to loveconnection.io would depend heavily on the user feedback. However, here are some potential upgrades that could be made.

1. **User Interface**: A smoother, more modern user interface could be appealing to users. Providing easy navigation for users is as critical as the website's aesthetics.

2. **Profile Customization**: Facilitating users to have more profile settings allows them to express themselves better. This could regard anything from color themes to profile structure.

3. **Improved Matching Algorithm**: An upgrade to how matches are made could result in better connections. More sophisticated algorithms could consider more factors or allow users to set specific preferences.

4. **Enhanced Chat Features**: An improvement could also be made in the chat system, such as quicker messaging or allowing video calls.

5. **Safety Features**: Enabling more safety features like reports, block, and mute functions can make users feel safer on the platform.
   
6. **Integration with Social Network**: Integrating your website with social media platforms can also provide seamless connectivity and more variety of user interaction.

Remember to involve your user base in making these decisions to ensure that the upgrades you're implementing are something they'd like to see.

The CourseNFT contract is a Solidity smart contract that models a basic education system where course creators can create courses, tests, tasks, and exams, all represented as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) using the ERC721 standard from OpenZeppelin.

Here's a brief overview of CourseNFT's main functions:

1. `createCourse()` - This function allows for the creation of a new course with a specific course name, description, and resource link.

2. `createTest()` - This function allows the creation of a new test associated with a course. Each test has an IPFS hash (presumably of the test's questions) and an array of correct answers.

3. `verifyTest()` - This function allows a test to be marked as verified, presumably after it has been reviewed and approved.

4. `createTask()` - This function allows for the creation of a new task associated with a course. Each task has an IPFS hash (presumably of the task's details).

5. `verifyTask()` - This function allows a task to be marked as verified and a score can be assigned to it, presumably after it has been reviewed and approved.

6. `createExam()` - This function allows for the creation of an exam associated with a course.

7. `verifyExam()` - This function allows an exam to be marked as verified, presumably after it has been reviewed and approved.

8. Getter functions (`getCourseDetails`, `getTestDetails`, `getTaskDetails`, `getExamDetails`, `getTestQuestionCount`) - These functions allow for fetching the details of a specific course, test, task, or exam.

The contract also emits various events to signify when a course, test, task, or exam has been created and verified.

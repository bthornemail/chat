The CourseNFT contract provided in this code is designed to handle different aspects of course creation, ranging from creating courses, tests, tasks, and exams, to verifying tests, tasks, and exams. An NFT (Non-fungible token) stores distinct information or attributes making them different from each other.

In the context of this contract:

- Each course, test, task, and exam will be unique and can be connected to different course creators or teachers.
  
- The 'Course' struct represents a course, with 'courseName', 'description', and 'resourceLink' presenting the details of the course.
  
- A 'Test' struct is used to store the details of the test, including the address of the creator, a boolean value for verification, the IPFS hash for the test, and a mapping for correct answers.
  
- The 'Task' struct is similar to the 'Test' struct, but it also includes a score attributed to the task.
  
- An 'Exam' struct contains the details of the exam, including the address of the creator, a boolean value for verification, and arrays to store the IDs of the respective tests and tasks.
  
- Finally, the contract includes various functions that allow for creating courses, tests, tasks, and exams, and also verifies each of these.

Through this contract, the handling and operations of a course, such as creating and verifying tests, tasks, and exams could be represented as NFTs on the blockchain.

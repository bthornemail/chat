Sure, I can provide a basic example of how you might layout the server and front-end files for this application.

**Front-end (HTML,JS)**

`index.html`:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>AssetNFT Marketplace</title>
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
  <script src="https://cdn.ethers.io/5.x/ethers.min.js"></script>
  <script src="web3.min.js"></script>
  <script src="assetNFT.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>AssetNFT Marketplace</h1>
  <button id="mint">Mint AssetNFT</button>
  <div id="assets"></div>
  <script src="main.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
`main.js`:
```javascript
document.getElementById('mint').addEventListener('click', function(){
  const name = prompt("Enter asset name");
  const description = prompt("Enter asset description");
  const value = prompt("Enter asset value in VertCoin");
  // convert prompt inputs into structure to pass to contract function
  var asset = { metadata:{name: name, description: description, value: value} };
  AssetNFT.methods.registerAsset(asset).send({from: ethereum.selectedAddress});
});

AssetNFT.events.AssetRegistered({}, function(error, event){ 
  console.log(event); 
});

AssetNFT.methods.getAssetDetails().call()
.then(function(assets){
  document.getElementById('assets').innerHTML = JSON.stringify(assets);
});
```

**Back-end (Node.js)**

`app.js`:
```javascript
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const port = 3000

app.use(express.json());

app.post('/mint', (req, res) => {
  // mint new AssetNFTs to the contract here
  const asset = req.body;
  // Pass asset to your contract mint function
  // For example: contract.methods.mintAsset(asset).send({from: account});
  res.send('Asset minted!');
})

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`AssetNFT app listening at http://localhost:${port}`)
})
```
In the above examples, inserting minted asset data is done via a simple prompt and no actual images are uploaded or viewed, and asset trading is not implemented. Also, VertCoin is assumed to be an ERC20 contract already deployed on the network and interacted within the contract itself, Helia is a NFT marketplace and also need to extend the capabilities to match the requirement.

Remember, to interact with Ethereum from a browser, your users will need to have an Ethereum wallet plugin like Metamask installed. You may also insert popular Ethereum libraries such as web3.js or ethers.js.

Finally, in the server file, actual code for calling the contract function (for example, minting an asset) is replaced by a comment, as that requires the contract instance and account details which depend on your setup.

This is just a basic guide and should be extended and adjusted according to your actual requirements and the contract's structure and functions. Reddis and EthersJS has not been included but can be added based on their specific function in your application.

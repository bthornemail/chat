Sure, Here are the steps that you need to create the landing page:

1. Connect to the Ethereum network via MetaMask using ethers.js and initialize the AssetNFT contract. 

2. Create a form to input the name, summary, description, value, image (using input type file to upload images), and a datasheet input with various dynamic key-value entries, and a submit button that only appear when the user is connected to MetaMask (ethers.js can be used to check if the user is connected). Use FormData to handle the form data and multiform data for the image.

3. Use the Helia API to store the image and datasheet in IPFS and get the URL that points to that data.

4. When the user submits the form, call the registerAsset() function on your AssetNFT contract passing in the metadata from the form (make sure to convert VertCoin amount to the correct decimal count) and also the IPFS URLs for the image and datasheet. ethers.js will be used to interact with the Ethereum contract.

5. Create an area on the page to display the list of all Assets NFTs minted in the contract. Call the getAsset() function to get the metadata of each Asset NFT and display them.

6. For each Asset NFT, create a button to initiate a trade. On button click, open a form to input the price (in VertCoin) and address of the new owner then call transferAsset() function on your contract to perform the trade.

It's really a complex task that cannot include all the details and exact code in one written response but the main idea will be as above. Make sure you understand and take care of the security considerations when dealing with blockchain and smart contract, including but not limited to user data security, gas fees, smart contract validation and error handling, etc.

You also need to remember that to handle events on your Ethereum contract, you have to listen for them and implement ways to update your page and reflect the changes when something happens on the blockchain. You'll use ethers.js for this purpose.

If you have any additional information, such as the existing smart contract code or the specific requirements for the UI/UX design, I'd be glad to help you further.

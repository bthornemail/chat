Here's a basic landing page structure using vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, Bootstrap, and Helia IPFS:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>ServiceNFT Landing Page</title>

  <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
  <link href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">

  <!-- Custom CSS -->
  <link href="./style.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>

<body>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="jumbotron mt-5">
      <h1 class="display-4">ServiceNFT Platform</h1>
      <p class="lead">A platform for buying and selling services as NFTs, powered by Helia IPFS</p>
    </div>

    <div id="service-registration-form" class="mt-5">
      <h2>Register a Service</h2>
      <!-- You can add the form here -->
    </div>

    <div id="service-purchase-form" class="mt-5">
      <h2>Purchase a Service</h2>
      <!-- You can add the form here -->
    </div>

    <div id="service-list" class="mt-5">
      <h2>Available Services</h2>
      <!-- You can load and display services from Helia IPFS here -->
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Helia IPFS and Web3 libraries -->
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/helia@^1.0.0/dist/index.min.js" defer></script>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/web3@1.2.9/dist/web3.min.js"></script>

  <!-- Your custom JavaScript where you'll interact with Helia IPFS and your ServiceNFT smart contract -->
  <script src="./index.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

In the `index.js` file, you could define functions like `registerService`, `purchaseService`, and `loadServices`, which would interact with Helia IPFS and your ServiceNFT smart contract.

Please note that this is a basic example, you will need to add all the functionalities with respective event listeners and also need to handle the connection to Ethereum and all the interactions with the smart contract.

This example assumes that you have a Web3.js-compatible Ethereum browser extension like MetaMask installed and the user is logged into it.

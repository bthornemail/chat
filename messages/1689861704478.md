The first step would be installing the required dependencies for your server. Since you are a full stack developer, assuming you're using Node.js, you would need to install ethers.js (library to interact with Ethereum), multi-part (to handle file uploads), and other necessary dependencies with npm (Node.js package manager).

```
npm install ethers express multer
```

Next, define the endpoints in the Express.js server. I'm providing examples for creating an AssetNFT contract, registering assets, and viewing assets. Trading an asset would involve transferring its ownership, that could be done from the frontend as well. 

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const multer = require('multer');
const path = require('path');
const { ethers } = require('ethers');
const fs = require('fs');
const router = express.Router();
const upload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' });

const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('http://localhost:8545'); // replace with your Ethereum node RPC URL
const privateKey = 'your-private-key'; // replace with your private key
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey, provider);

// Read the compiled contract artifact for AssetNFT
const artifact = require('./path-to-your-compiled-contract-artifact.json');
const contractAddress = 'your-contract-address'; // replace with your deployed contract address
const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, artifact.abi, provider);

// Define routes
router.post('/mint', async (req, res, next) => {
    const contractWithSigner = contract.connect(wallet);

    try {
        // Execute mint function from the smart contract
        const tx = await contractWithSigner.mint(req.body);
        res.status(200).send(tx);
    } catch (err) {
        next(err);
    }
});

router.post('/register', upload.single('image'), async (req, res, next) => {
    const contractWithSigner = contract.connect(wallet);
    const { name, summary, description, value, datasheet } = req.body;
    const image = fs.readFileSync(path.resolve(req.file.path)); // read image file

    try {
        // Call registerAsset function from the Smart Contract
        const tx = await contractWithSigner.registerAsset(name, summary, description, value, datasheet, image.toString('base64'));
        res.status(200).send(tx);
    } catch (err) {
        next(err);
    }
});

router.get('/assets', async (req, res, next) => {
    try {
        // Call getAssets function from the Smart Contract
        const assets = await contract.getAssets();
        res.status(200).send(assets);
    } catch (err) {
        next(err);
    }
});

module.exports = router;
```

This is a basic setup and there's definitely more to consider like error handling, user authentication, etc. Also, remember that, for production, server side environment variables should be used for sensitive information like private keys. It's not safe to hardcode such values, especially when the code is publicly available.

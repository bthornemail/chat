MoversOnlineNow is proposed to be a decentralized and open network service designed for independent moving contractors. The platform aims to connect individuals or businesses who need moving services with independent contractors who provide these services. 

Key functions that the platform plans to offer include: 

1. Tracking jobs offered and accepted.
2. Managing escrow funds to ensure secure transactions.
3. Tracking ratings and reviews of account holders to maintain service quality.

The platform would operate on the Ethereum blockchain and use off-chain signed typed-data transactions and messages to manage jobs. The system appears to be planning to use the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to interface with smart contracts and limit liability. 

It's important to note that this description is based on a proposal and the actual implementation could vary.

While the names you've mentioned such as 'P2P Market', 'OpenSwap', 'Open Exchange', 'Peer Connect Marketplace' are all accurate descriptors, they are also fairly generic and could be confused with other projects. For your Vertcoin and its focus on being a decentralized marketplace for trustless trading of services, knowledge, and assets, below are some unique names that align with your vision:

1. TrustTrade
2. PeerPlace
3. KnowledgeSwap
4. AssetArcade
5. CryptoConnect
6. DecentDeal
7. TrustLessTrade
8. OpenServExchange
9. P2PAssetMarket
10. VertMarket

Before deciding on a name, it's always good to do some research to ensure the name isn't already being used or trademarked. You can do this by searching the name in various search engines, social media platforms, the iOS and Android app stores, and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Officeâ€™s trademark database.

Please note that "OpenSwap" is already a decentralized exchange and "Open Exchange" is a widely used term referring to the non-private trading platforms.

CourseNFT is a Solidity smart contract that tokensizes educational content such as courses, exams, tasks, and tests on the blockchain. This contract is based on the ERC721 token standard which allows each token to have unique properties.

Here are some key features of the smart contract:

- A Course, Test, Task, and Exam are defined as struct types. Each of these structures has specific attributes. For instance, a Test has attributes such as a creator, verification status, an IPFS hash for storing the test details, and a mapping for correct answers.
- There are different mappings to store Test, Task, Exam, and Course instances against their IDs. These mappings are kept private.
- The contract has functions to create a Course, Test, Task, and Exam. There are also functions to verify a Test, Task, or Exam which would set the `verified` status to `true`.
- It emits events when a Course is created, a Test is created and verified, a Task is created and verified, and when an Exam is created and verified.
- The contract also provides getter functions to fetch detailed information about a Course, Test, Task, or Exam.

Essentially, CourseNFT uses NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) to represent ownership or participation in an educational course. This could be used for course registration, issuance of certifications, tracking progress, and more all in a decentralized, transparent manner.

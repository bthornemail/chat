The CourseNFT is a script written in Solidity for a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.

This contract allows a user to create tokens representing a course which include tasks, exams, and tests. Each of these items (Course, Test, Task, Exam) are stored as individual structures and are given an ID for easy access and verification. 

The contract allows a course to be created with a name, description, and a resource link. A Test or Task can be created for a specific Course and can later be verified. An Exam (which encompasses several Tests and Tasks) can be created and verified as well.

All actions within the contract trigger specific events which log the activity (like CourseCreated, TestVerified, etc).

Key features of this smart contract are the creation and management of Tests, Tasks, and Exams for a specific course, in the form of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).

The `TypeError: Member "testIds" not found or not visible after argument-dependent lookup in struct CourseNFT.Course storage ref.` indicates that there is no `testIds` member in struct `Course` defined in the CourseNFT smart contract.

So, if you want to add a `testId` to the `testIds` array of the `Course` struct, you should define `testIds` as a member of the `Course` struct. For example:

```solidity
struct Course {
    string courseName;
    string description;
    string resourceLink;
    uint256[] testIds;
    uint256[] examIds;
}
```

Ensure `testIds` is defined as an array of `uint256` in the `Course` struct. Please check your struct definition and make sure that `testIds` is defined in it.

The CourseNFT is a Solidity smart contract that represents a course as a non-fungible token (NFT) on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes features to create a new course, validate tests and tasks, and handle exams. 

This contract uses the ERC-721 standard from OpenZeppelin, which provides a standard implementation for non-fungible tokens, also known as deeds.

In the context of the smart contract:

- A 'course' represents the NFT and has properties like the course name, description, resource link, and associated exams.

- A 'test' is part of a course and has properties like the creator, a verification status, an IPFS hash for storing the test data off-chain, and correct answers.

- A 'task' is like a test but it also has a score associated with it.

- An 'exam' consists of multiple tests and tasks. 

Each of these components (course, test, task, exam) are represented as structs and mapped to unique IDs. The smart contract provides functions to create, verify, and fetch these components. 

The contract also emits events for important actions performed on the blockchain for tracking purposes, like creating a course, verifying a test, creating a task, etc.

You can start by defining the various routes needed in the server to interact with the AssetNFT contract as explained below. Note that you will need to import `ethers.js` library to interact with the smart contract.

```javascript
import { ethers } from "ethers";
import express from 'express';
import multer from "multer";

const router = express.Router();
const upload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' });

// Add a provider
let provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(/*RPC URL*/);

// The contract address deployed on the network
let contractAddress = "";

// The contract ABI 
let contractABI = []; // provide the contract ABI

// Contract object
let contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, contractABI, provider);

// Route to create a new AssetNFT contract
router.post("/createContract", async (req, res) => {
    let factory = new ethers.ContractFactory(contractABI, contractBytecode, wallet);
    let contract = await factory.deploy(/* constructor arguments */);
    await contract.deployed();
    res.send(contract.address);
});

// Route to mint new AssetNFTs
router.post("/mint", async (req, res) => {
    const { address, assetId } = req.body;
    let transaction = await contract.mint(address, assetId);
    let tx = await transaction.wait();
    res.send(tx);
});

// Route to register assets
router.post("/register", upload.single('image'), async (req, res) => {
    const { name, summary, description, value, datasheet } = req.body;
    let metadata = {
      image: req.file.path, // Assuming `image` is the name of the file input field
      name,
      summary,
      description,
      value,
      datasheet
    };
    
    let transaction = await contract.registerAsset(JSON.stringify(metadata));
    let tx = await transaction.wait();
    res.send(tx);
});

// Route to view assets
router.get("/assets", async (req, res) => {
    let assets = await contract.getAssets();
    res.send(assets);
});

// Route to trade assets
router.post("/trade", async (req, res) => {
    const { assetId, newOwner } = req.body;
    let transaction = await contract.transferAsset(assetId, newOwner);
    let tx = await transaction.wait();
    res.send(tx);
});
```

Remember to replace placeholders denoted by `/* */` with appropriate values.

Note: This implementation handles image upload in a very basic way by storing the image to a local uploads directory and storing the path to the image in the metadata. For a robust solution, consider using a file storage cloud service such as AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blobs. Then store the URL of the uploaded image in the metadata.
  
Also the given code acts as a starting point. Consider error handling and user authentication as per your requirements.

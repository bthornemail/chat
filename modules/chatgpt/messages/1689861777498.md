The error messages point towards modules that are missing and a property 'file' that does not exist on the Express Request object. 

Here is how you can fix each issue:

1. Cannot find module 'ethers', 'multer', './contractABI.json', './VertCoin.json'
   
   This error is occurring because the specific modules are not found in your project. Make sure that you have installed the ethers, multer npm packages and the json files do exist in your project. 
   Confirm by checking node_modules directory for ethers and multer. 
   
   If not found, you can install these packages using the following command(s):
    ```
    npm install ethers multer
    ```
    If json files are missing, ensure that the path provided is correct.

2. Property 'file' does not exist on type 'Request<{}, any, any, ParsedQs, Record<string, any>>' :

   The 'file' property is added by the multer middleware to the request when it processes a file upload. If this middleware is not used, or used wrongly, the 'file' property would not be present on the request. 
   
   Make sure that the POST route at '/api/assets' is properly using the multer middleware for file uploads.
   
   Here is a basic example of multer usage:

   ```javascript
   // Set multer storage
   const storage = multer.diskStorage({
     destination: function (req, file, cb) {
     cb(null, './uploads')
    },
    filename: function (req, file, cb) {
      cb(null, file.originalname)
    }
   })

   const upload = multer({ storage: storage})

   app.post('/api/assets', upload.single('fieldname'), (req, res, next) => {
   // Get file data from req.file
   })
   ```
   Replace 'fieldname' with the name of the file input field in your request. Make sure your form's encoding type is set to multipart/form-data.
   
Following these steps should fix your code.

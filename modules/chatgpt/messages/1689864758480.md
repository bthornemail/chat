Sure. To achieve those functionalities, you would need to create relevant Ethereum smart contracts for the AssetNFTs and VertCoin. For interactions with these contracts, **Ethers.js** library would be used.

To upload and view images, you could use IPFS for decentralized storage. Here is a blueprint for creating the express.js API endpoints, make sure to replace the commented sections with your actual contract calls or implementations:

```ts
import express from 'express';
import path from 'path';
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
// Import Ether.js logic here

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use(express.json())
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }))

// Create AssetNFT Contract
app.post('/create-asset-nft-contract', async (req, res) => {
    // Create Contract Logic here
    // Using the provided ethers library, create a new contract instance
})

// Mint new AssetNFTs to contract
app.post('/mint-asset-nft', async (req, res) => {
    // Mint Logic here
    // Call the mint function on your AssetNFT smart contract
})

// Register Assets
app.post('/register-asset', async (req, res) => {
    const { name, summary, description, value, datasheet, imageUrl } = req.body;
    if (!(name && summary && description && value && datasheet)) {
        return res.status(400).json('Missing required fields');
    }
    // Register the Asset using AssetNFT contract
    // Save uploaded image to IPFS and get the image hash back
})

// View Assets
app.get('/view-assets', async (req, res) => {
    // Return all assets from the AssetNFT contract
})

// Trade Assets
app.post('/trade-asset', async (req, res) => {
    const { assetId, newOwner } = req.body;
    if (!(assetId && newOwner)) {
        return res.status(400).json('Missing required fields');
    }
    // Trade assets using AssetNFT contract
})

// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on port http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```
Make sure to use the escrow pattern to ensure safe trades between users. 

Note: This is a basic example. You should have proper logic to interact with the Ethereum network and smart contracts. 

For IPFS, you would want to look at NFT.Storage or Pinata SDKs for making the process of uploading to IPFS easier from Javascript or NodeJS. 

Remember that dealing with blockchain requires you to care about the security and proper handling of private keys, managing nonces for different transactions, etc. Please read the documentation about Ethers.js and Solidity to make sure that you are aware of these considerations.

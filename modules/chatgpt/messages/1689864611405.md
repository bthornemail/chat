In the context of this question, we need to make multiple enhancements to our server API. Here's an example of how you might modify your server code to handle these operations. Note that this is a high-level overview and does not include error handling and other necessary production-grade measures.

Firstly, to interact with the smart contracts, you may use the ethers.js library (already in your dependencies) to construct contract instances. However, the ABI of the AssetNFT contract is necessary. Thus, the ABIs should be either imported or hardcoded into the program.

Now, let us outline changes for each of your requirements:

1. Create an AssetNFT contract:
    
Assuming you already have a factory contract set up, add an endpoint in your server file to interact with this factory contract:

 ```javascript
app.post("/createAssetNFTContract", async (req, res) => {
    const factoryContract = new ethers.Contract(factoryAddress, factoryABI, provider);
    const transactionResponse = await factoryContract.createAssetNFTContract({ gasLimit: 500000 });
    const transactionReceipt = await transactionResponse.wait(); 
    res.json({ transactionReceipt });
})
 ```

2. Mint new AssetNFTs:

You would first need a mint function in your AssetNFT contract. Then, add a new endpoint:

```javascript
app.post("/mintAssetNFT", async (req, res) => {
    const { contractAddress, to, tokenId } = req.body;
    const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, AssetNFTABI, provider);
    const transactionResponse = await contract.mint(to, tokenId, { gasLimit: 500000 });
    const transactionReceipt = await transactionResponse.wait(); 
    res.json({ transactionReceipt });
})
```

3. Register assets:

Assuming your AssetNFT contract has a function for registering assets, you can create another endpoint to handle this.

```javascript
app.post("/registerAsset", async (req, res) => {
    const { contractAddress, metadata, name, summary, description, value, datasheet } = req.body;
    const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, AssetNFTABI, provider);

    // TO-DO: Upload Image and other data to a storage (IPFS, etc.) and obtain imageHash

    const transactionResponse = await contract.registerAsset(metadata, name, summary, description, imageHash, value, datasheet, { gasLimit: 500000 });
    const transactionReceipt = await transactionResponse.wait(); 

    res.json({ transactionReceipt });
})
```

4. View assets:

Add a new endpoint for viewing a specific asset:

```javascript
app.get("/getAssetDetails", async (req, res) => {
    const { contractAddress, tokenId } = req.body;
    const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, AssetNFTABI, provider);
    const assetDetails = await contract.getAssetDetails(tokenId);
    res.json({ assetDetails });
})
```

5. Trade assets:

Assuming your AssetNFT contract comprises a function for transferring assets, you can formulate an additional endpoint to handle this.

```javascript
app.post("/transferAsset", async (req, res) => {
    const { contractAddress, from, to, tokenId } = req.body;
    const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, AssetNFTABI, provider);

    const signer = provider.getSigner(from)
    const contractWithSigner = contract.connect(signer);

    const transactionResponse = await contractWithSigner.transferAsset(from, to, tokenId, { gasLimit: 500000 });
    const transactionReceipt = await transactionResponse.wait();

    res.json({ transactionReceipt });
})
```

Notice how the 'provider.getSigner()' method is used for catching the wallet associated with the address 'from' and is then appointed as the contract's signer.

Here are the steps to create new endpoints for interacting with AssetNFT contracts:
1. Install the following additional libraries:
   - `@openzeppelin/contracts`: Provides reusable contracts for Ethereum.
   - `multer`: A middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, which is used for file uploads.
   - `ipfs-http-client`: A client library for the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).

   You can install these libraries using the following commands:

   ```bash
   npm install @openzeppelin/contracts multer ipfs-http-client
   ```

2. Import `ethers` for interacting with Ethereum, `multer` for handling file uploads, and `ipfs-http-client` for interacting with IPFS at the top of your `server.ts` file:
   ```ts
   import { ethers } from "ethers";
   import multer from "multer";
   import ipfsClient from "ipfs-http-client";
   ```

3. Initialize IPFS client and multer:
   ```ts
   const ipfs = ipfsClient({ host: "localhost", port: "5001", protocol: "http" }); // Initialize the IPFS client
   const upload = multer({ dest: "uploads/" }); // Initialize multer and define directory to store uploaded files
   ```

4. Create a route for registering an AssetNFT contract:
   ```ts
   app.post("/register-asset-nft-contract", async (req, res) => {
      // Instantiate a new contract factory using the AssetNFT contract ABI and bytecode
      const AssetNFTFactory = new ethers.ContractFactory(AssetNFT_ABI, AssetNFT_BYTECODE, wallet);

      // Deploy the contract
      const AssetNFTContract = await AssetNFTFactory.deploy();

      // Wait until the contract is deployed
      await AssetNFTContract.deployed();

      // Respond with the contract address
      res.json({ contractAddress: AssetNFTContract.address });
   });
   ```

   Here, `AssetNFT_ABI` and `AssetNFT_BYTECODE` are the ABI and bytecode of the AssetNFT contract respectively, and `wallet` is an instance of `ethers.Wallet` that will be used to deploy the contract.

5. Create a route for minting new AssetNFTs and registering assets:
   ```ts
   app.post(
    "/mint-asset-nft",
    upload.single("image"), // Handle file upload
    async (req, res) => {
      const { name, summary, description, value, datasheet, contractAddress } = req.body;

      // Upload image to IPFS and get the CID
      const imageResult = await ipfs.add(fs.readFileSync(req.file.path));
      const imageCid = imageResult.cid.toString();

      // Instantiate the contract using the contract address
      const AssetNFTContract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, AssetNFT_ABI, wallet);

      // Create metadata
      const metadata = {
        name,
        summary,
        description,
        image: `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/${imageCid}`,
        datasheet,
      };

      // Mint new AssetNFT
      const tx1 = await AssetNFTContract.registerAsset(JSON.stringify(metadata));
      await tx1.wait();

      // Transfer VertCoin to the contract
      const tx2 = await VertCoinContract.transfer(contractAddress, value);
      await tx2.wait();

      // Respond with the transaction receipts
      res.json({ registerAssetTx: tx1, transferVertCoinTx: tx2 });
    }
  );
   ```

  Here, `VertCoinContract` is a contract instance of the VertCoin contract, and `wallet` is an instance of `ethers.Wallet` that will be used to interact with the contracts. 

6. Create a route to view assets:
   ```ts
   app.get("/view-assets/:contractAddress", async (req, res) => {
      const { contractAddress } = req.params;

      // Instantiate the contract using the contract address
      const AssetNFTContract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, AssetNFT_ABI, wallet);

      // Call the `totalSupply` function of the contract
      const totalSupply = await AssetNFTContract.totalSupply();

      // Loop over all token IDs and get the details of each asset
      const assets = [];
      for (let i = 0; i < totalSupply; i++) {
        const tokenURI = await AssetNFTContract.tokenURI(i);
        const asset = await axios.get(tokenURI);
        assets.push(asset.data);
      }

      // Respond with the assets
      res.json(assets);
    });
    ```

7. Create a route to trade assets:
   ```ts
   app.post("/trade-assets", async (req, res) => {
      const { fromContractAddress, toContractAddress, tokenId, toAddress } = req.body;

      // Instantiate the contracts using the contract addresses
      const fromAssetNFTContract = new ethers.Contract(fromContractAddress, AssetNFT_ABI, wallet);
      const toAssetNFTContract = new ethers.Contract(toContractAddress, AssetNFT_ABI, wallet);

      // Approve the toContract to manage the asset on behalf of the owner
      const tx1 = await fromAssetNFTContract.approve(toContractAddress, tokenId);
      await tx1.wait();

      // Transfer the asset from the current owner to the new owner
      const tx2 = await toAssetNFTContract.safeTransferFrom(wallet.address, toAddress, tokenId);
      await tx2.wait();

      // Respond with the transaction receipts
      res.json({ approveTx: tx1, transferTx: tx2 });
    });
    ```

This example assumes you have an instance of `ethers.Wallet` to interact with the Ethereum network. Adjust it as needed based on your Ethereum setup.

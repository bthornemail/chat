The error you're seeing is due to Solidity not being able to find the `testIds` member of the `Course` struct. Here's how to address this:

Firstly, ensure that the struct `Course` has an array member called `testIds`. Here is the correct example for your context:

```solidity
struct Course {
        string courseName;
        string description;
        string resourceLink;
        uint256[] examIds;
        uint256[] testIds;   // <-- This line should be presented
}
```

Secondly, when you're trying to use `testIds` you should make sure that you're actually operating on an instance of `Course`. Since you've declared `courses` as a mapping from uint256 to `Course`, you need to first retrieve the Course instance using its corresponding id.

Hopefully this will help resolve your issue. Please make sure that you have correctly defined your structs and mappings, and are referring to them appropriately in your code.

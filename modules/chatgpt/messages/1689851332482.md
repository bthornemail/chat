Without any specific details or context about your current front end, here are a few general suggestions that you could consider:

1. **Improve User Interface Design**: Prioritize a clean, simple user interface. Too much clutter can distract or overwhelm users, so only show what's necessary. 

2. **Optimize for Mobile**: Make sure your website offers a good user experience on mobile devices given the increasing traffic from such devices.

3. **Loading Speed**: Slow loading speeds can cause users to leave. Optimize your images, minify your CSS and JavaScript, and consider implementing lazy loading.

4. **Ease of Navigation**: Users should be able to easily navigate your site or app and find the information they need.

5. **Colors and Fonts**: Use colors and fonts consistently and in line with your brand.

6. **Accessibility**: Be inclusive by designing your user interface to be accessible for all users, including those with disabilities.

7. **Implement User Feedback**: Regularly gather feedback from your users and implement changes based on their suggestions.

8. **Use of Animations**: Proper use of animations can enhance user experience when used in moderation. 

Remember, these are suggestions and depend on specific use cases and requirements. Consider them as a starting point for further investigation and improvements.

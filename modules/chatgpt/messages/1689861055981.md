While I can provide you with a basic landing page that covers your needs, such as creating AssetNFT contracts, minting new AssetNFTs, or registering and viewing assets, a truly effective and functional website would require more than just a single landing page. The implementation of trading assets and handling transactions with VertCoin would likely require a more complex back-end setup, including managing user wallets, performing transactions, and securely keeping track of asset ownership changes.

Here's an example of what the landing page could look like:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>AssetNFTs</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div>
        <h1>AssetNFTs</h1>
        <p>Create and trade your assets as NFTs.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="create-asset-form">
        <h2>Create a new AssetNFT</h2>

        <label for="name">Name:</label>
        <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
        
        <label for="description">Description:</label>
        <input type="text" id="description" name="description">

        <button id="mint-btn">Mint AssetNFT</button>
    </div>

    <div id="assets">
        <h2>Your Assets</h2>
        <!-- assets will be appended here dynamically -->
    </div>

    <div id="trade-asset-form">
        <h2>Trade an Asset</h2>

        <label for="asset-id">Asset ID:</label>
        <input type="text" id="asset-id" name="asset-id">

        <button id="trade-btn">Trade Asset</button>
    </div>

    <script src="app.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
```javascript
// In your app.js
document.getElementById('mint-btn').addEventListener('click', async () => {
    const name = document.getElementById('name').value;
    const description = document.getElementById('description').value;

    // Add code here to mint the asset

    // This is a mock object that you may replace with the real NFT data
    const asset = {
        name,
        description,
    };

    // Append the new asset to the assets section
    const newAssetElement = document.createElement('div');
    newAssetElement.innerHTML = `
        <div>
            <h3>${asset.name}</h3>
            <p>${asset.description}</p>
        </div>
    `;

    document.getElementById('assets').appendChild(newAssetElement);
});
```

To make the website interact with the Ethereum blockchain and the smart contract, you would use ethers.js in your JavaScript code. Please note that handling VertCoin transactions and uploading and viewing images would necessitate additional steps, such as requiring a way to upload and store images (possibly using a service like IPFS), and creating or integrating a wallet system that can manage VertCoin transactions.

To add the required functionality to the server API, first you need to make sure you have installed necessary libraries and have properly imported them in server.ts. These libraries would include a Solidity compiler and a client library to interact with Ethereum such as Web3.js or Ethers.js. Since I see "ethers" in your package list, you will be using Ethers.js.

```typescript
import { ethers } from "ethers";
import multer from "multer";

const upload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' });

// Asset management endpoints
app.post("/assets/create", async (req, res) => {
    const { name, summary, description, datasheet, value } = req.body;
    const image = req.file;
    
    // Convert VertCoin value to wei
    const valueInWei = ethers.utils.parseEther(value.toString());

    // Upload image to IPFS and get the hash 
    const imageHash = await uploadToIPFS(image);

    // Create new AssetNFT, assuming you have the contract instance and signer
    const tx = await assetNFTInstance.connect(signer).registerAsset(
        name, 
        summary,
        description,
        datasheet,
        imageHash,
        valueInWei
    );

    await tx.wait(); // Wait for the transaction to be mined

    res.json({ message: 'Asset created!', tx });
});

app.get("/assets", async (req, res) => {
    const assets = await assetNFTInstance.getAssets();
    res.json(assets);
});

app.post("/assets/trade", async (req, res) => {
    const { from, to, assetId } = req.body;

    const tx = await assetNFTInstance.connect(from).transferAsset(assetId, to);

    await tx.wait(); // Wait for the transaction to be mined

    res.json({ message: 'Asset traded!', tx });
});
```

In this code, I made the following assumptions:
- `assetNFTInstance` is your NFT contract instance
- `signer` is an Ethers.js object representing someone who can sign transactions
- `uploadToIPFS` is a function to upload file to IPFS and return the IPFS hash

You will need to adjust these portions according to your actual situation.
 
This example also uses `multer`, a middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, which is primarily used for uploading files. Please install it via npm by running `npm install --save multer`.

Note that the Solidity contract needs to be compiled and deployed before any of these server operations can be performed. The contract should also include the methods used in these endpoints otherwise you will run into issues executing the endpoints.

Additional validation and error handling should be added to make the code robust and secure.

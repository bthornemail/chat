The issue here is with the use of mappings inside the struct. Solidity doesn't (currently) allow for assignments like what we see in `tests[testId] = Test(msg.sender, false, _ipfsHash);`, when there's a nested mapping inside of a struct. 

There are primarily two ways to resolve this issue: 

1. **Do each assignment individually.** Instead of trying to reset the entire struct in one command, you can set each field of the struct individually.

   Replace this line:
    ```solidity
    tests[testId] = Test(msg.sender, false, _ipfsHash);
    ```
   With:
    ```solidity
    Test storage test = tests[testId];
    test.creator = msg.sender;
    test.verified = false;
    test.ipfsHash = _ipfsHash;
    ```
2. **Use a different data structure.** If you find yourself needing a more complex nested data structure, you may want to consider using a different data structure entirely, like an array or a different kind of mapping.

Keep in mind that Solidity is designed to be different and more secure than other programming languages, so there might be a better approach depending on what you're trying to achieve.
